## Pull requests checklist

- [] Commits are atomic and follow conventional commits
  - (e.g. `feat: add X`, `fix: correct Y`, `chore: update deps`).
- [] Local linting, formatting and TypeScript type checks passed:
  - `npm run lint`, `npm run format` and `npm run typecheck`.
- [] Unit and integration tests added or updated where applicable;
  - existing tests pass: `npm run test`.
- [] Build succeeds: - `npm run build`.
- [] Updated documentation or README if public behavior changed.
- [] Screenshots attached for UI changes.
